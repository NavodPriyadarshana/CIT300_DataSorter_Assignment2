## 📖 Project Overview
This Java program compares the performance of three common sorting algorithms — **Bubble Sort**, **Merge Sort**, and **Quick Sort** — by measuring:
- Execution time (in milliseconds)
- Number of comparison operations performed  

It uses a **menu-driven interface** that allows users to:
1. Enter numbers manually or generate random data  
2. Perform each sorting algorithm individually  
3. View a **comparison table** of all algorithms  

The system was developed collaboratively using **GitHub branches and pull requests**.

## 🧩 Features
- User-friendly console menu  
- Supports manual and random data input  
- Displays execution time and operation counts  
- Side-by-side performance comparison  
- Structured with OOP concepts and modular code organization

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented
| Algorithm | Description | Complexity |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Bubble Sort** | Repeatedly compares and swaps adjacent elements | O(n²) |
| **Merge Sort** | Divides array into halves, sorts, and merges | O(n log n) |
| **Quick Sort** | Uses a pivot to partition and recursively sort | O(n log n) |
